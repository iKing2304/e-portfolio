            <p class="entryJournal">Google software engineer, the title I want to have after graduation. Applying a job for a tech company abroad is one of my goals,
                to achieve that, I should practice on basic level programming like HTML and CSS. Learning HTML, CSS and few scripts blew my mind
                up on how hard programming might be. I was reaching the point of giving up, but with this project, I also became closer to my classmates. We also
                played Valorant after a long day (and night) of coding for our project. We also bonded after a short meeting, played mobile games and talked about
                different things. Hard projects become easy with team work, if the work is balanced all throughout the group. I realized that web developers differ
                from web designers, they both have specific fields of specialization. For me, lay outing of a site is quite hard because it involves color combination
                and the art of design. I tend to make my websites minimal because I’m that kind of person.</p>

            <p class="entryJournal">    After a long day of programming, I realized that all of these experiences are just basics of computer programming,
                I will have more difficulties and experience when I grow in Computer Science while studying the art of programming.
                It’s hard at first, but I always remind myself of my goal, to be a Google software engineer.

            <p class="entryJournal">During this quarantine, we started our online class. I am still having a rough time adjusting to it because
                of the many problems we can encounter during the process. I am both excited and nervous of the subject. I am really looking forward in
                learning from it and meeting new people, and nervous of how I am going to progress because of the current situation we are in. I have zero
                knowledge of the course which is also one of the reasons why I'm nervous.</p>

            <p class="entryJournal">During the process, our professor gave us several activities so she can monitor on how well do we
                understand the lessons. Our first activity is "The Impact of Internet and WWW" Infographics. In this activity,
                we will gather information of the given topic and make a visual understanding of it. I really had fun doing this activity
                because it is giving me additional information of the subject, and also brings out my creativity in making the design of the infographic.
                The next is creating a video about "History of Computers". In this activity, we are divided in groups, and will create a content about it.
                We didn't encounter any problems while doing it because the members of the group does their individual tasks equally. It also widens my knowledge
                about computers while researching information about it. Another is creating a "List Tags" according to the image provided by our professor. In this
                activity, we are tasked to re-create the "List Tags" using HTML. I had fun doing it because I am finally starting to do some codes. I researched some
                of the codes that aren't provided by our professor so it kind of serves to me as a self-study because I am really fond of the subject. Next is the "Tables".
                In this activity, we are tasked to copy the image of tables provided by our professor using codes. This is the time where I got challenged because the codes
                are not converting right to the image I am doing. I searched for some references but I still had a hard time understanding how it works so I asked helped to
                some of my classmates and still think I failed, but I still did my best. The last is creating an " E - Portfolio" in a form of a website. I am still currently
                doing this activity, so I am giving all my time and effort in this one because this serves as our Finals.</p>

            <p class="entryJournal">I have learned so much from these activities, also with the help of our professor, I get to understand most of the things
                that I got complicated with. It was really fun and enjoyable process because I am learning from the subject, and know have the confidence
                to keep up with my classmates because of having the pressure of having zero knowledge before.</p><br>

            <p class="entryJournal">Due to COVID-19 we are force to be quarantined
                and because of this we started online class. I am having a rough time in this new normal because
                of the internet here in the philippines we are rank 97 out of 207 who has the slowest internet speed
                around the world with an mbps of 6.07 and download time of 1h and 52mins. I also have the lack of materials
                needed in this online class because I have 2 brothers who are also studying and we only have 1 computer to share
                and sometimes our schedule is the same and it's giving us a hard time to study in this online class. </p>

            <p class="entryJournal"> Even though we are having a rough time in this new normal I manage to survive in my online schooling our
                professor gave us several activities so that our professor can see if we are keeping up with her. Our first activity was
                "The Impact of the Internet and WWW" we were task to explain this in an Infographic. In this activity we learned many things
                as we gathered imporant information as we are about to explain the topic. Our second activity was "History of Computers". In this
                activity we are divided into two groups to make an video about the topic. We encounter many problems due to the slow internet connection
                and our house chores that we needed to do although we had problems we manage to get through it and eventually finished our activity. Our
                third activity was "List Tags" our professor gave us an file that were going to re-create the "List Tags" using HTML. I was amazed doing it
                although it is basic programming I had fun and learned many new things. Our fourth activity was the "Tables" In this activity our professor
                gave us a file to re-create the table. In this activty I was hardly challenge because I really don't know what to do there are many codes that
                I do not know to complete the task, but thanks to the w3schools I have found the solution on how to re-create the table that our professor has
                given us. Our last but not the least activity was doing an "E-Portfolio" in the word itself we are going to make an portfolio but not with a paper
                and pen but doing it in a form of Website. We are still doing this activity and giving all our time and effort to finish this activity as it is the most
                challenging activity that we did in this subject.</p>
                
            <p class="entryJournal"> I have learned many things from the activites that our professor gave.
                Thanks to miss Maridel Negradas she taught us many things on how to understand every detail
                in our subject without her we couldn't have finish every activty she gave us. It was really fun and challenging I
                enjoyed every minute of it on how I progress in this subject, how I manage to keep up with my classmates because I really don't have background on
                programming. Thank you Miss Negradas.</p><br>

                I've learned a lot from this course that I can really apply to my future career.
                I really like to do things that are related to computer works especially programming,
                and I am really glad that I took Bachelor of science in Computer Science so I Could have a
                great skills in programming. </p>

                <p class="entryJournal">ITE Subject taught us about the history of computers, The Internet, World Wide Web and also the
                basics of hyper text Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) so we could create our own
                Web pages, having basic knowledge is important because it is my starting point to understand how the logic of
                programming works and this basic knowledge about html and css will be a great foundation for the bigger things.
                But in order for us to create functional great Web pages with astonishing designs we have to broaden our knowldege
                about it and W3 schools, stack overflow, soloLearn, YouTube tutorials and many more educational Websites and apps
                also contributed a lot in order for me and my classmates to complete our Courseworks and Major output. These website 
                helped me to widen improve my skills and knowledge about htmls and css that I did apply to my assignments. There might 
                be times that I get stuck with running my programs but that will not make me give it up because I know that these are 
                the things that I have truly want so I will always make a way for it to properly run the way it supposed to be. </p>

            <p class="entryJournal">I will continue to stay motivated during the learning process so I could achieve my goals.
                The learning experiences to this subject is very enjoyable and we have made a fast progress and
                I am really grateful about that. The subject itself is really fun especially about programming when
                you know what you are doing and good at debugging. My professor and classmates made the class meetings
                more enjoyable and interesting because of our shared knowledge and exchanges of information  and our professor
                made it easy for us to understand computer and programming in the best way possible.</p>

                They have provided me so much that I can call myself a "freshie" in the new norm. in this pandemic. I have learned so much
                in CSS and HTML that I can fully do what I need to do.</p>

            <p class="entryJournal">Even though there are times that I have trouble with coping up with my lessons,
                Difficulty in making courseworks. My colleagues, My friends and my buddies help me get over that obstacle by
                pushing me to study harder than before. This helped me realize that with a little bit of hardwork and determination,
                I can succesfully accomplish or triumph over adversities.</p><br>

            <p class="entryJournal">Many people are affected because of Covid 19 that spreading to our country
                and because of that we are forced to use the online learning. As a student I am having a hard
                time adjusting in this new normal. But even though it's hard for me to adjust I can still manage
                to do the school works and learn something.</p>

            <p class="entryJournal"> I took Bachelor of Science in Computer Science or should I say BSCS, because it is very
                interesting.
                I was very curious; I want to know on how to create Web sites. And I think this subject ITE helps me to
                know on how to do it.</p>
                
            <p class="entryJournal">    I have learned a lot
                in this course that I know I can use it in the future. I had so much fun doing the
                activities that our professor gave us, yes sometimes it's hard because a lot of the time i always
                forgot the semicolon or sometimes the end pair that is why it takes me a lot of time to finish the activity.
                But the important is I can still manage to finish my activity and submit my work on time.
