<p>Due to COVID-19 we are force to be quarantined and because of this we started online class. I am having a rough time in this new normal because of the internet here in the philippines we are rank 97 out of 207 who has the slowest internet speed around the world with an mbps of 6.07 and download time of 1h and 52mins. I also have the lack of materials needed in this online class because I have 2 brothers who are also studying and we only have 1 computer to share and sometimes our schedule is the same and it's giving us a hard time to study in this online class.<p>

<p>Even though we are having a rough time in this new normal I manage to survive in my online schooling our professor gave us several activities so that our professor can see if we are keeping up with her. Our first activity was "The Impact of the Internet and WWW" we were task to explain this in an Infographic. In this activity we learned many things as we gathered imporant information as we are about to explain the topic. Our second activity was "History of Computers". In this activity we are divided into two groups to make an video about the topic. We encounter many problems due to  the slow internet connection and our house chores that we needed to do although we had problems we manage to get through it and eventually finished our activity. Our third activity was "List Tags" our professor gave us an file that were going to re-create the "List Tags" using HTML. I was amazed doing it although it is basic programming I had fun and learned many new things. Our fourth activity was the "Tables" In this activity our professor gave us a file to re-create the table. In this activty I was hardly challenge because I really don't know what to do there are many codes that I do not know to complete the task, but thanks to the w3schools I have found the solution on how to re-create the table that our professor has given us. Our last but not the least activity was doing an "E-Portfolio" in the word itself we are going to make an portfolio but not with a paper and pen but doing it in a form of Website. We are still doing this activity and giving all our time and effort to finish this activity as it is the most challenging activity that we did in this subject.</p> 

<p>I have learned many things from the activites that our professor gave. Thanks to miss Maridel Negradas she taught us many things on how to understand every detail in our subject without her we couldn't have finish every activty she gave us. It was really fun and challenging I enjoyed every minute of it on how I progress in this subject, how I manage to keep up with my classmates because I really don't have background on programming. Thank you Miss Negradas.</p>
